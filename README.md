Some of the things I learned throughout the process of completing this project include:

* More extensive flexbox usage
* Utilizing objects and accessing functions using bracket notation
* Referencing an id to using in a function, inside of an EventListener
* Adding functionality rather than focusing on a single problem
* Adding keyboard support for an originaly click-driven system
